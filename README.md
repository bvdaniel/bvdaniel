# Hi, I’m Daniel Beltrán  

I’m a builder and founder working on projects that challenge norms and create real-world impact through **Web3 innovation** and **decentralized finance**.  

## What I’m Working On
- **A0X**: An agentic protocol that aims to create a new workforce open for everyone to build their own agents to be hired. [A0x](https://a0x.co)
- **A0x-Tokenization**: We help bussineses that want to tokenize their projects and be onboarded to the onchain economy. [A0x](https://a0x.co)
- **CLPD**: The first Chilean stablecoin. Built on Base L2. Designed to bring the chilean economy onchain. [clpd](htpps://clpd.a0x.co)

## What I Believe  
- Decentralization is the antidote to outdated systems.  
- Web3 isn’t just tech—it’s a shift in power and possibilities.  
- The best solutions are simple, scalable, and unapologetically bold.  

## How I Work  
- Balancing global scalability with local impact.  
- Adding art and passion to everything I do.  

## Let’s Collaborate
