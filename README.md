# Hi, I’m Daniel Beltrán  

I’m a builder and founder working on projects that challenge norms and create real-world impact through **Web3 innovation** and **decentralized finance**.  

## What I’m Working On

- **CLPD**: The first Chilean stablecoin. Built on Base L2. Designed to bring the chilean economy onchain.  [clpd](htpps://clpd.mistokens.com)

## What I Believe  
- Decentralization is the antidote to outdated systems.  
- Web3 isn’t just tech—it’s a shift in power and possibilities.  
- The best solutions are simple, scalable, and unapologetically bold.  

## How I Work  
- Balancing global scalability with local impact.  
- Embracing complexity to deliver simplicity.  

## Let’s Collaborate  
If you’re building in Web3, fintech, looking to land LATAM, or just have an idea that might sound crazy to most—let’s talk.
